# A-B-Testing-Results-Project

The goal of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
